## Overview

**Project Title**: Rustman

**Project Description**: The iconic game of Hangman, replicated in Rust. Guess words chosen from a random list one letter at a time; however, any incorrect guesses will hurt your lives. Run out of lives, and you're done for! Also includes the ability to change the number of allowed missed guesses (lives) for each game, and the ability to choose from different themes for the word to guess (as well as create word lists yourself to play).

**Project Goals**: Further my understanding of the Rust programming language, syntax, functionality, and limitations by creating a game entirely using Rust and libraries created for it within two weeks.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

### Using Executable (Rust not needed)
Coming Soon!

### Using Command Prompt / Terminal
1. If not already installed, [download and install the most recent version of Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). This should install all the necessary components (including Cargo).
2. Download the repository contents to your computer. You can either download the repository contents as a .ZIP file, or use git / GitHub Desktop to copy the repository to your device.
3. Open a Command Prompt, Terminal, or equivalent program on your device.
4. Navigate to the "rustman" folder (using `cd` on Windows).
5. Type `cargo run` to start the program.

### Using Visual Studio Code
1. If not already installed, [download and install the most recent version of Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). This should install all the necessary components (including Cargo).
2. Download the repository contents to your computer. You can either download the repository contents as a .ZIP file, or use git / GitHub Desktop to copy the repository to your device.
3. Open Visual Studio Code, and open the folder containing the project ("rustman").
4. Open a terminal (Terminal > New Terminal) and type `cargo run` in the terminal. The program will run using the terminal built into Visual Studio Code.

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Add in capitals handling (disallow capital letters for lists & game input)
* [ ] Add additional words to current list & more word lists
* [ ] Add mid-game quit option
* [ ] Add the ability to delete word lists
* [ ] Save/load functionality for saving word lists & current lives
